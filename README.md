this site displays Ghibli Studio films that were ever made.

I had an issue with the open API and had to get the info from GitHub and host it on my local device. So I got really short of time to add any other function because of that. 

so please take that in mind. 

the API folder is in this link you need to clone it and run it on localhost and change the link in fetch accordingly if needed: https://github.com/janaipakos/ghibliapi
